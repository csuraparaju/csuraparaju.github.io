> *As each new author finds cleverer proofs or treatments of a theory, the treatment evolves towards the one that contains the 'shortest proofs'. Unfortunately, these are often in a form that causes the new student to ponder 'How did anyone think this?' By going back to the original sources, one can usually see the subject evolving naturally.”*
