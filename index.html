								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
								<p>Hello there, my name is Krish Suraparaju! I'm a rising senior at Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI, which is a free, 
									co-educational, public school of excellence that enrolls approximately 100 academically accelerated 11th and 12th grade students from Massachusetts.
									Read more about my school <a href="https://www.massacademy.org">here.</a>
								<br><br>My academic interests mainly lie in research areas concering neuroscience and applied computer science. This past year, I won the 2nd place award at Worcester Regional Science 
								and Engineering Fair and the 3rd place award at the state Masacchusetts Science and Engineering fair for my research in computational neuroscience. Read more about it <a href="#work">here.</a>

								<br></br>In my free time, I love to play tennis, pencil sketch and/or paint, and game with my friends. Although I'm not the best at tennis, I try to play with my friends whenever I can because of
								 its relaxing, monotone nature. As far as sketching goes, I generally like to draw landscapes, but I have recently started drawing portraits of my friends. 
								</p>

								<br>Please contact me in the contact page if you want a copy of my resume!</br>

								<h2 class="main">Using Deep Neural Networks <br> for  the Early Diagnosis of <br> Parkinson's Disease</h2></h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This past year, I decided to work on developing a predictive diagnosis method for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). 
									In brief, PD is a neurolgical disorder that hinders a person's movement and cognitive abilities. Traditionally, the method of 
									diagnosis has been a clinical examination, which is not very good at predicting future prognosis. In order to solve this 
									problem, I decided to develop a neural network that analyzes a patient's brain MRI scans and determines if they are showing any early signs
									for PD. Using this newly developed tool, I then tested two different diagnositc protocols and determine which one produced the highest accuracies. 
									Refer to my published work <a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4SAVU">here</a> for more details.</p>

								<h2 class="main">A Comprehensive Application <br> for the Early Detection of <br> Dementia</h2></h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>While working on the cognitive symptoms of my research project, I noticed a lack of comprehensive tools that elderly people can use to keep 
									track of their mental state of being. So, as an addition to my research project, I also decided to work on creating a cohesive web application 
									that users can use intermittently to make sure they are not showing early signs of dementia. 
									
									<br></br>The general data flow for the 
									app is as folows: users upload speech recordings of themselves answering certain questions taken from the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) to the website.
									These files are then sent to a private server hosted by Flask, where they are analyzed for speech biomarkers. At the end, the custom written algorithm will produce 
									a score that represents the user's mental well being. This score is sent back to the website so that the user can see how they performed. The user is asked to 
									take the test again over the next few months. If there is a general downward trend to the user's scores, they are alerted to visit the doctor's office
									and get tested for neurological diseases. Refer to my <a href="https://github.com/csuraparaju/CSIndepProj.git">Github repo</a> for more information.
