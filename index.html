								<p>Hello there, my name is Krish Suraparaju! I'm a rising senior at Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI, which is a free, 
									co-educational, public school of excellence that enrolls approximately 100 academically accelerated 11th and 12th grade students from Massachusetts.
									Read more about my school <a href="https://www.massacademy.org">here.</a>
								<br><br>My academic interests mainly lie in research areas concerning neuroscience and applied computer science. Last year, I won the 2nd place award at Worcester Regional Science 
								and Engineering Fair and the 3rd place award at the state Massachusetts Science and Engineering fair for my research in computational neuroscience. Read more about it <a href="#work">here.</a>

								<br></br>In my free time, I love to play tennis, pencil sketch and/or paint, and game with my friends. Although I'm not the best at tennis, I try to play whenever I can because of
								 its relaxing, monotone nature. As far as sketching goes, I generally like to draw landscapes, but I have recently started drawing portraits of my friends.

								<h2 class="main">Using Deep Neural Networks for  the Early Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease</h2></h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Last year, I decided to work on developing a predictive diagnosis method for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). 
									In brief, PD is a neurological disorder that hinders a person's movement and cognitive abilities. Traditionally, the method of 
									diagnosis has been a clinical examination, which is not very good at predicting future prognosis. In order to solve this 
									problem, I decided to develop a neural network that analyzes a patient's brain MRI scans and determines if they are showing any early signs
									for PD. Using this newly developed tool, I then tested two different diagnostic protocols and determine which one produced the highest accuracies. 
									Refer to my work <b><a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4SAVU">here</a></b> for more details.</p>

								<h2 class="main">Modeling Neural Circuits As Interconnected Graphs</h2></h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/connectome.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Intrigued by the brain, I wanted to learn more about the inner workings of its functionality. That's why I'm currently working with Dr. 
									Elizabeth Ryder, a professor of Computational Biology at WPI, to model neural circuits as a physical structure that can be visualized and simulated. 
									Click <b><a href="https://www.suraparajuneuralcircuits.software/">here</a></b> to see my current progress.

								<h2 class="main">A Comprehensive Application for the Early Detection of Dementia</h2></h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In recent years, I noticed a lack of comprehensive tools that elderly people can use to keep 
									track of their mental state of being. So, I decided to work on creating a cohesive web application 
									that users can use intermittently to make sure they are not showing early signs of dementia. 
									
									<br></br>The general data flow for the 
									app is as follows: users upload speech recordings of themselves answering certain questions taken from the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) to the website.
									These files are then sent to a private server hosted by Flask, where they are analyzed for speech biomarkers. At the end, the custom written algorithm will produce 
									a score that represents the user's mental well-being. This score is sent back to the website so that the user can see how they performed. The user is asked to 
									take the test again over the next few months. If there is a general downward trend to the user's scores, they are alerted to visit the doctor's office
									and get tested for neurological diseases. Refer to my <b><a href="https://github.com/csuraparaju/CSIndepProj.git">Github repo</a></b> for more information.

								<h2 class="main">Selected Examples of my Work During my Junior year</h2>
								<p>During my junior year at MAMS, I've had the opportunity to learn countless skills. So, I've decided to pick ones that I'm most proud of and showcase
									some of them here.</p>
								<br>

								<h2 class="main">Modeling a Rocket Using Elementary Calculus </h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>During my time in the MAMS Physics class, I often had the opportunity to pick a real world physics problem and apply the concepts we learned in class to solve it. 
									For this particular assignment, I was asked to model the motion of a rocket that is under non-constant acceleration (caused by rocket engine as well as a parachute).
									So, I used elementary calculus topics such as the derivative definition of acceleration and velocity to accurately model its motion and determine how 
									long the rocket would remain in the air. Click <b><a href="docs/Uber_Rocket_Calculus_Problem.pdf">here</a></b> for more details.</p>
								
								<br>
								
								<h2 class="main">Models for Easing Traffic in Tunnels </h2>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>One skill emphasized in my math class was using Mathematical to model solutions for real world problems. At the beginning of the year, we were asked to 
									come up with a plan that would ease traffic in a tunnel during morning/evening rush hours. My solution to this problem consisted of four models builds
									 upon the results of the previous one to create a final recommendations. Click <b><a href="docs/Easing_Traffic.pdf">here</a></b> for more details.</p>
								
								<br>
								
								<h2 class="main">Project Euler Problems</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Before starting work on our independent project, the Advanced CS students were asked to program solutions for some Project Euler problems. These are a series of 
									challenging computer programming problems. Most of these questions could not be solved using brute force approaches, so developing space and time efficient algorithms
									were crucial. Click <b><a href="docs/Project_Euler.pdf">here</a></b> to view my solutions to the problems.</p>
