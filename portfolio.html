                    <br></br>
                    <p>Going into the UChicago Trading Competition, I had zero experience with algorithmic trading.
                        It was completely new territory for me, but being selected as one of around 150 students to
                        participate was an awesome opportunity to learn.
                        <br><br>
                        I worked with my team for about 3 weeks and came up with  a pairs trading algorithm for trading
                        seven correlated assets. This was a form of statistical arbitrage that
                        computed fair values for a set of assets based on a rolling window of historical
                        price data. The algorithm would identify potential trading opportunities when the prices of these
                        assets deviated from their expected "mean", and execute trades to capitalize on the eventual
                        convergence back to equilibrium.

                    <p>Participating in the Data Open was a great experience that
                        allowed me to learn more about data analysis and machine learning. Working in a team of four, we solved
                        an interesting problem â€“ developing a model to identify parks in New York City that
                        need maintenance. Our breakthrough came from creating a mixed dataset consisting of geo-satellite
                        images of parks and user-uploaded pictures from social media platforms like Twitter and Flickr.
                        Using this diverse dataset, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network capable of
                        classifying the health and maintenance needs of over 1,500 parks across the city.

                    <h3>Algorithm for RNA Structure Prediction</h3>
                    <br></br>
                    <p> I worked with in a team of four to produce a novel algorithm for predicting the secondary structure of
                        RNA, a famous open problem in computer science. In RNA secondary structure prediction,
                        base-pair probabilities refer to the likelihood of two  nucleotides (bases) in an RNA sequence forming a
                        bond. These probabilities provide valuable about the potential secondary structure of the RNA molecule.

                        <br></br>
                        My teammates worked on developing a convolutional neural network that can take in a sequence of RNA string,
                        and output the base pair probabilities. However, the probabilities alone do not directly translate
                        into the full secondary structure sequence. So, I worked on a dynamic programming algorithm could decode
                        and construct the most likely secondary structure. It did this by identifying the optimal combination
                        of base pairs that maximized the overall probability of the sequence. This approach allowed us to leverage the predictive power of
                        the neural network while incorporating algorithmic techniques to derive the final RNA secondary structure predictions accurately.

                    <h3>High Performance Deep Learning Library</h3>
                    <br></br>
                    <p> For the past couple of months, I've been working on a high performance deep learning library
                        written in C++, similar to PyTorch. I am diving deep into the linear algebra and calculus concepts
                        behind neural networks, making sure to derive important concepts (such as the gradient descent algorithm )
                        myself. By using C++ and the Eigen library, I'm prioritizing speed and performance, taking advantage of Eigen's
                        ability to execute large matrix operations at blazing speeds over 16,000 MFLOPS. Although challenging,
                        this project is solidifying my understanding of neural network fundamentals and sharpening my C++ skills.
