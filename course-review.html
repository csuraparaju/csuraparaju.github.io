                                            <h4>Professor(s): Anil Ada, Pravesh Kothari</h4>

                                                CMU's 15-251 is a must take course for any computer scientist. It is the first rigorous
                                                study of computation, and will teach you the importance of mathematics in computer science.
                                                The course covers a wide range of topics, from the study of various models of computation such as
                                                discrete finite automaton, turing machines and random-access machines, to complexity theory, graph theory and
                                                cryptography. It is a very challenging course, but it is also very rewarding. The problem
                                                sets are difficult and often requires you to apply topics learned from lecture in a new way.
                                                Homeworks are done in the form of weekly writing sessions, where you have to reproduce proofs to
                                                selected homework problems independently in an exam-like setting. The exams are also challenging,
                                                but they are fair. Both Anil Ada and Pravesh Kothari are engaging lecturers, and they are
                                                both very approachable. The TAs are also incredibly helpful.

                                                    15-213, Intro to Computer Systems, was a tough but valuable course at CMU. It covered a lot of low-level
                                                    details about how computers actually work under the hood - from machine code and memory management to concurrency
                                                    and networking. While the material was dense at times, it gave me a solid understanding of systems programming.

                                                    My favorite homework was the malloc lab where we optimized the C malloc implementation. Getting into the
                                                    nitty-gritty of memory allocation was really interesting. My least favorite was probably the sfs (shark file system)
                                                    lab where we built a thread-safe file system. Dealing with concurrency and debugging race conditions was quite
                                                    challenging.

                                                    Overall though, 15-213 taught me skills that will be useful for writing efficient, robust code.
                                                    Even though it was challenging at times, I'm glad I took the course and learned how everything fits together at a low level.

                                            11-481 covers the basics of neural networks,
                                            from multi layer perceptrons to convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The course
                                            is very hands-on, and you will get to implement all the essential algorithms in deep learning
                                            such as gradient descent and backpropagation from scracth. Each homework is split into two parts,
                                            part one and part two. Part one of an assignment asks you to implement a deep learning library akin
                                            to PyTorch from scratch using python and numpy. The cumulation of all the part ones is a fully
                                            functional deep learning library that you can use to train your own neural networks. Part two of an
                                            assignment is more hands on and asks you to use existing frameworks like PyTorch to implement
                                            a neural network to solve a real world problem. For example, Homework 2 part 2 was to implement a
                                            Convolutional Neural Netowrk for recognizing previously seen faces. Bhiksha is an engaging professor,
                                            although he can be a bit much sometimes. He often has class on holidays, and even assigns homework due
                                            during university wide breaks.

                                                    Neural Computation was an interesting and insightful course that covered topics
                                                    absolutely essential for anyone interested in studying deep learning or artificial intelligence.
                                                    Understanding how the brain computes and processes information, encodes data, and learns
                                                    is foundational knowledge for building intelligent systems inspired by biological neural networks.
                                                    The lectures covers concepts like neural encoding/decoding strategies (sprase coding), neural network
                                                    learning models (Hebbian learning, Lateral Inhibition), signal processing in the brain (encoding in action potential
                                                    spikes), and probabilistic inference - drawing concrete examples from vision and motor control systems.

                                                    However, while the lecture content was interesting, the course itself felt poorly organized at times.
                                                    The problem sets, done in MATLAB, could get quite tedious and repetitive despite the interesting subject matter.
                                                    Thanks to a relatively straightforward grading scheme, it was pretty east to get an A in the class.

                                            This was a class that went beyond just programming
                                            and instead covered the broader principles of building successful software systems. The lectures were quite
                                            interesting, covering topics like requirements gathering, project management, microservice architecture,
                                            and economic trade-offs. However, the homeworks were a nightmare. We inherited a large, unfamiliar open source
                                            codebase and had to design and implement new features in it. Since the codebase changed every term, even the TAs
                                            hadn't worked with it before, so they weren't very helpful during office hours for debugging issues.
                                            The most interesting and useful lecture for me was the last one where he talked about how to decode software
                                            engineering job offers and negotiate for better compensation and roles. If you have a software engineering internship
                                            coming up, I suggest you take this class before because it prepares you well for the jargon and practices
                                            that's used in industry.

                                            Pisztora's 21-325 is an introductory to probability theory course. It covers the basics of probability theory, from
                                            random variables to the central limit theorem. The course is proof heavy, and requires you to be comfortable with
                                            infinite series and sequences. The homeworks are often easy and sometimes require you to perform even mindless computation.
                                            The exams, are not easy and there's always one question that is challenging. Pisztora puts a heavy emphasis on
                                            discrete random variables in the first half of the course, causing it to be a bit boring.  It is clear that Pisztora does not prepare
                                            for his lectures, and often makes mistakes. Overall, I would not recommend this course unless you are a math major.

                                            This is a standard, run of the mill, multivariable calculus course. It covers the basics, from
                                            3D vectors to partial derivatives and multiple integrals. The course is very computation heavy,
                                            and requires you to be comfortable with calculus 1. Professor O'dorney is a new hire for CMU and it
                                            is clear that he is still getting used to teaching. He does not have practice material for his exams,
                                            and his homeworks are sometimes tricky. However, he is very approachable and is always willing to help.
                                            Overall, I would recommend this course if you want to get any pre-requisites out of the way, but I would
                                            not recommend it if you want to gain a deeper understanding of multivariable calculus. Instead, I suggest
                                            you take 21-268 or 21-269.

                                                    CMU's 21-127 was my first introduction to formal mathematics
                                                    and proof writing. The course provided me with new perspectives
                                                    on discrete math and reshaped my view of mathematics as a formal
                                                    logical system. I found the transition to this formal style
                                                    challenging but rewarding as it deepened my mathematical reasoning
                                                    skills. Clive Newstead was an amazing lecturer. During his office
                                                    hours, he would often go into the history of theorems and proofs,
                                                    which I found fascinating. Though this course is required for most
                                                    STEM majors at CMU, I would highly recommend non-STEM majors to take

                                                    15-122 was my first computer science class at CMU. It teaches you how to
                                                    write  provably safe and correct programs in a subset of C called C0.
                                                    The course is very difficult to get an A in as a freshman since a lot of
                                                    the material is new and it is designed to be challenging. Regardless,
                                                    I found the course to be rewarding as it taught me how to implement the
                                                    data structures and algorithms used in the industry in a bare-bones
                                                    language. The programming assignments are actually interesting, and the final project
                                                    for the course even requires you to implement a virtual machine in C. Overall,
                                                    I think 15-122 is a great introduction to computer science, and has the added
                                                    benefit of making you a well-versed in C right off the bat. Functions are pointers!

                                                    15-150 is CMU's introduction to functional programming course. It is taught in
                                                    Standard ML, and teaches you how to write provably correct programs using the functional programming paradigm.
                                                    Unlike 15-122, 15-150 is quite easy to get an A if you take it with Erdmann and Crary. The
                                                    programming assignments are challenging, but the exams are very reasonable. The course
                                                    gave me a new perspective on programming, one that I think is very useful for writing correct
                                                    code. For example, it's interesting to see that since every SML function is recursive, we can prove
                                                    correctness of our programs using induction. Some of the proofs are very elegant, especially ones
                                                    relating to functors and modules. I attended Crary's lectures, and he was amazing. Some people thought he went too fast,
                                                    but that's why I liked him. He was very clear and concise, and his explanations were
                                                    better than Erdmann's. 15-150 is overall an excellent course, and I would highly recommend it to anyone
                                                    interested in computer science. Functions are values!

                                                    with Dr. Bellah. It covers the basics, from vector spaces to linear transformations
                                                    and eigen-things. It's proof heavy with Dr. Bellah, with little to no computation.

                                                    wanted us to focus on the theory. Overall, it is pretty easy to get an A in this class
                                                    because of how generous the grading is. Although the exams are all proofs, they are very
                                                    straightforward and are not designed to trick you. This course with Dr. Bellah is great
                                                    if you want to get any pre-requisites out of the way, but I would not recommend it if you
                                                    want to gain a deeper understanding of linear algebra. Instead, I suggest you take 21-241

                                                    The Chemistry department's Honors introduction to Chemistry course is not as
                                                    enjoyable as Honor's Biology. The topics covered during lectures are mostly
                                                    AP Chemistry review, but the exams are much more difficult. Be ready to
                                                    learn a lot of organic chemistry and physical chemistry! The course is
                                                    challenging, but it is not impossible to get an A. The exams are very hard,
                                                    but there is plenty of extra credit opportunity. However, what made the course
                                                    not as enjoyable, thought, was Dr. Sherwood's classes. Her lectures were often
                                                    confusing, and worst of all, she was very dismissive of your questions. Often, she would move past a topic without explaining it well,
                                                    and if you asked her to clarify, she would say something along the lines of "you
                                                    should know this already". The TAs were very helpful, though, and I would recommend
                                                    going to their office hours. Overall, I would not recommend this course unless you
                                                    are a chemistry major.
