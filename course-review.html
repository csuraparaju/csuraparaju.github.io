                            Below are a list of courses I have taken during my time at 
                            Carnegie Mellon University. I included a brief review of
                            each course, what I liked and disliked, and
                            any other general comments regarding the material. Courses 
                            that I thought were particularly interesting are marked with üåü,
                            and courses that I think makes CMU worth attending are marked with
                            ‚ù§Ô∏è.

                                <h4>Professor(s): Clive Newstead</h4>
                                <p>
                                    CMU's 21-127 was my first introduction to formal mathematics
                                    and proof writing. The course provided me with new perspectives 
                                    on discrete math and reshaped my view of mathematics as a formal
                                    logical system. I found the transition to this formal style 
                                    challenging but rewarding as it deepened my mathematical reasoning 
                                    skills. Clive Newstead was an amazing lecturer. During his office 
                                    hours, he would often go into the history of theorems and proofs,
                                    which I found fascinating. Though this course is required for most
                                    STEM majors at CMU, I would highly recommend non-STEM majors to take
                                    it with Clive since it provides a new perspective on mathematics.

                    <h3>15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation</h3>
                    <h4>Professor(s): Iliano Cervesato, Dilsun Kaynar</h4>
                    <p>
                        15-122 was my first computer science class at CMU. It teaches you how to
                        write  provably safe and correct programs in a subset of C called C0. 
                        The course is very difficult to get an A in as a freshman since a lot of 
                        the material is new and it is designed to be challenging. Regardless,
                        I found the course to be rewarding as it taught me how to implement the
                        data structures and algorithms used in the industry in a bare-bones
                        language. The programming assignments are actually interesting, and the final project
                        for the course even requires you to implement a virtual machine in C. Overall,
                        I think 15-122 is a great introduction to computer science, and has the added
                        benefit of making you a well-versed in C right off the bat. Functions are pointers!

                    <h3>15-150: Principles of Functional Programming üåü </h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Michael Erdmann, Karl Crary</h4>
                                <p>
                                    15-150 is CMU's introduction to functional programming course. It is taught in
                                    Standard ML, and teaches you how to write provably correct programs using the functional programming paradigm.
                                    Unlike 15-122, 15-150 is quite easy to get an A if you take it with Erdmann and Crary. The 
                                    programming assignments are challenging, but the exams are very reasonable. The course 
                                    gave me a new perspective on programming, one that I think is very useful for writing correct
                                    code. For example, it's interesting to see that since every SML function is recursive, we can prove 
                                    correctness of our programs using induction. Some of the proofs are very elegant, especially ones
                                    relating to functors and modules. I attended Crary's lectures, and he was amazing. Some people thought he went too fast, 
                                    but that's why I liked him. He was very clear and concise, and his explanations were
                                    better than Erdmann's. 15-150 is overall an excellent course, and I would highly recommend it to anyone 
                                    interested in computer science. Functions are values!

                    <h3>02-251: Great Ideas in Computational Biology ‚ù§Ô∏è</h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Phillip Compeau</h4>
                                <p>
                                    02-251 made me fall in love with Computational
                                    Biology, and is one of the main reasons I am working at Mohimani Lab right now. Essentially,
                                    the course is a survey of all the pivotal algorithms that gave birth to the field of
                                    Computational Biology. From genome sequencing, to systems biology, to even neural networks,
                                    02-251 covers it all. It is a theory heavy class as a lot of the algorithms
                                    discussed make use of advanced techniques such as dynamic programming and graph theory. 
                                    Be prepared to do a lot of proofs about graphs and trees, but also  
                                    get ready to implement a lot of algorithms from scratch. From the Needleman-Wunsch alignment
                                    algorithm to creating multi layer perceptrons, this course will teach you how to 
                                    implement the most infuential algorithms in Computational Biology. Phillip is an excellent 
                                    lecturer, and his passion for the subject is evident in his lectures. He is also very 
                                    approachable and is always willing to help. Although the official pre-reqs for this class are only
                                    15-112 and 21-127/21-128/15-151, I would recommend taking 15-122 either before or concurrently 
                                    since it will help you with the programming assignments. Whether you are a computer scientist, 
                                    biologist, chemist, or mathematician, 02-251 is a must take course.

                    <h3>15-251: Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science</h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Anil Ada, Pravesh Kothari</h4>
                                <p>
                                    CMU's 15-251 is a must take course for any computer scientist. It is the first rigorous
                                    study of computation, and will teach you the importance of mathematics in computer science.
                                    The course covers a wide range of topics, from the study of various models of computation such as 
                                    discrete finite automaton, turing machines and random-access machines, to complexity theory, graph theory and 
                                    cryptography. It is a very challenging course, but it is also very rewarding. The problem 
                                    sets are difficult and often requires you to apply topics learned from lecture in a new way.
                                    Homeworks are done in the form of weekly writing sessions, where you have to reproduce proofs to 
                                    selected homework problems independently in an exam-like setting. The exams are also challenging, 
                                    but they are fair. Both Anil Ada and Pravesh Kothari are engaging lecturers, and they are 
                                    both very approachable. The TAs are also incredibly helpful.

                    <h3>11-485: Introduction to Deep Learning üåü</h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Bhiksha Raj</h4>
                                <p>
                                  11-481 covers the basics of neural networks,
                                  from multi layer perceptrons to convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The course
                                  is very hands-on, and you will get to implement all the essential algorithms in deep learning
                                  such as gradient descent and backpropagation from scracth. Each homework is split into two parts,
                                  part one and part two. Part one of an assignment asks you to implement a deep learning library akin 
                                  to PyTorch from scratch using python and numpy. The cumulation of all the part ones is a fully
                                  functional deep learning library that you can use to train your own neural networks. Part two of an
                                  assignment is more hands on and asks you to use existing frameworks like PyTorch to implement 
                                  a neural network to solve a real world problem. For example, Homework 2 part 2 was to implement a 
                                  Convolutional Neural Netowrk for recognizing previously seen faces. Bhiksha is an engaging professor, 
                                  although he can be a bit much sometimes. He often has class on holidays, and even assigns homework due 
                                  during university wide breaks.

                  <h3>21-325: Probability Theory</h3>
                  <h4>Professor(s): Agoston Pisztora</h4>
                  <p>
                    Pisztora's 21-325 is an introductory to probability theory course. It covers the basics of probability theory, from
                    random variables to the central limit theorem. The course is proof heavy, and requires you to be comfortable with
                    infinite series and sequences. The homeworks are often easy and sometimes require you to perform even mindless computation. 
                    The exams, are not easy and there's always one question that is challenging. Pisztora puts a heavy emphasis on 
                    discrete random variables in the first half of the course, causing it to be a bit boring.  It is clear that Pisztora does not prepare 
                    for his lectures, and often makes mistakes. Overall, I would not recommend this course unless you are a math major.

                                <h4>Professor(s): Jonathan Minden</h4>
                                <p>
                                  Taking Honors Modern Biology as a freshman was one of the highlights of my 
                                  first year in college. I found the subject material fascinating, especially
                                   learning about the intricate molecular processes that enable biological systems
                                    to function. The accelerated pacing gave Minden to dive deeper into 
                                    cell biology and molecular concepts, which I loved. Getting to spend more
                                     class periods exploring the molecular side of biology was engaging and helped
                                      cement foundational knowledge. Professor Miden's infectious passion for 
                                      biology was obvious during his lively lectures. His enthusiasm brought the 
                                      material to life and inspired me to pursue biology coursework. Though 
                                      challenging, Honors Modern Biology provided a great introductory experience
                                       that stimulated my interest in the subject. The course offered a
                                        rigorous yet captivating overview of key biological concepts, setting me
                                         up well for more advanced study, and giving me an excellent background
                                         in biology when working on computational biology projects.

                    <h3>09-107: Honors Modern Chemistry</h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Gizelle Sherwood</h4>
                                <p>
                                  The Chemistry department's Honors introduction to Chemistry course is not as 
                                  enjoyable as Honor's Biology. The topics covered during lectures are mostly 
                                  AP Chemistry review, but the exams are much more difficult. Be ready to 
                                  learn a lot of organic chemistry and physical chemistry! The course is
                                  challenging, but it is not impossible to get an A. The exams are very hard,
                                  but there is plenty of extra credit opportunity. However, what made the course
                                  not as enjoyable, thought, was Dr. Sherwood's classes. Her lectures were often 
                                  confusing, and worst of all, she was very dismissive of your questions. Often, she would move past a topic without explaining it well, 
                                  and if you asked her to clarify, she would say something along the lines of "you
                                  should know this already". The TAs were very helpful, though, and I would recommend 
                                  going to their office hours. Overall, I would not recommend this course unless you
                                  are a chemistry major.

                    <h3>21-241: Matricies and Linear Transformations</h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Elisa Bellah</h4>
                                <p>
                                    This is a standard course in linear algebra, especially when taken
                                    with Dr. Bellah. It covers the basics, from vector spaces to linear transformations
                                    and eigen-things. It's proof heavy with Dr. Bellah, with little to no computation.
                                    Believe it or not, she allowed us to use online calculators for row reducing as she 
                                    wanted us to focus on the theory. Overall, it is pretty easy to get an A in this class
                                    because of how generous the grading is. Although the exams are all proofs, they are very
                                    straightforward and are not designed to trick you. This course with Dr. Bellah is great
                                    if you want to get any pre-requisites out of the way, but I would not recommend it if you
                                    want to gain a deeper understanding of linear algebra. Instead, I suggest you take 21-241
                                    with Dr. Jason Howell, or even 21-242.

                    <h3>21-259: Calculus in 3D</h3>
                    <h4>Professor(s): Evan O'dorney</h4>
                    <p>
                      This is a standard, run of the mill, multivariable calculus course. It covers the basics, from
                      3D vectors to partial derivatives and multiple integrals. The course is very computation heavy,
                      and requires you to be comfortable with calculus 1. Professor O'dorney is a new hire for CMU and it
                      is clear that he is still getting used to teaching. He does not have practice material for his exams,
                      and his homeworks are sometimes tricky. However, he is very approachable and is always willing to help.
                      Overall, I would recommend this course if you want to get any pre-requisites out of the way, but I would
                      not recommend it if you want to gain a deeper understanding of multivariable calculus. Instead, I suggest
                      you take 21-268 or 21-269.

                      <h4>Professor(s): James Best</h4>
                      <p>
                        Great course to fill a general education requirement. It covers the basics of microeconomics, and is 
                        quite easy.
